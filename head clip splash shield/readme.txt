The obviousness of ending up at this design results from existing work (even long before the pandemic of 2020) and 
continued open source work shared by other individuals and companies. 

The two files we share include an injection molded design and 3D printable design. Both 
designs use transparent face shields with holes puched using a standard American 3 hole paper punch. This is the
basis for whatever transparent shield pattern you want to use.


SeeMeCNC's work includes inpiration from the following:

 > Prusa rc2 brackets
    The SeeMeCNC shield is similar but differs by keeping the bracket rigid and
     uses the transparent shield to snap over the posts.

 > 3d Verkstan face shield bracket design
    The SeeMeCNC head clip portion is modified by adding typical eyeglasses twist
      to the head-clip portion for comfort and greatly improved anti-slipping. The
      forehead portion is made to specifically contact the center of the head and
      the overall width is increase, while the rear clips curve in significantly to 
      improve anti-slip further.

 > Typical Dentists visor face shields (existing many years before the pandemic)
     They are purchased by dentists everywhere. This makes this variation of faceshield 
     created by SeeMeCNC very obvious as a solution to the face shield need during
     the current pandemic. It is quite obvious for anyone skilled in the art of 
     splash or face shields to combine these things using little imagination. 
     Therefore it is only natural to share the evolution of SeeMeCNc's work and the
     inspiration of others who have shared ideas as OPEN SOURCE.

> And, just web search "Plastic Sun Visor" and find tons of plastic head clip styles to
    refer to. Many also have clear visors too, make it quite obvious to adopt for the 
    needs of the pandemic and splash shielding.
