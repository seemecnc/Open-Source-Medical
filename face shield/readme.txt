Hello, 

This headband is designed to be injection molded. This is what I'm good at. I did not do this to be different. I
did this so other companies can just begin. 

The headband is compatible with Prusa rc2 (test fit the 3D model). And we are cutting the injection mold tonight. 

This design can printin 1 hour 15 minutes using a 0.7mm nozzle. I did this using Atomics PETG filament for the test. 

The license is "Whatever you want to do with our design". 

Sincerely, 
Steve
