March 25 2020 - changes to close off the top of the face shield design

March 30 2020 - closed the top on the injection molded part and added a completely new DXF new shield pattern.

Hello, 

This headband is designed to be injection molded. This is what I'm good at. I did not do this to be different. I
did this so other companies can just begin. 

The headband is compatible with Prusa rc2 (test fit the 3D model). And we are cutting the injection mold tonight. 

This design can printin 1 hour 15 minutes using a 0.7mm nozzle. I did this using Atomics PETG filament for the test. 

The license is "Whatever you want to do with our design". 

USE THIS INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK, PROVIDED WITH OUT WARRANTY AS IS.

Sincerely, 
Steve
